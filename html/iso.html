          <h2>What is ISO Speed in photography?</h2>
          <p>In very basic terms, ISO is simply a camera setting that will brighten or darken a photo. <br>
             As you increase your ISO number, your photos will grow progressively brighter. For that reason, <br>
              ISO can help you capture images in darker environments, or be more flexible about your aperture <br>
               and shutter speed settings. However, raising your ISO has consequences. A photo taken at too hig <br>
               h of an ISO will show a lot of grain, also known as noise, and might not be usable. So, brightening <br>
                a photo via ISO is always a trade-off. You should only raise your ISO when you are unable to brighte <br>
                n the photo via shutter speed or aperture instead (for example, if using a longer shutter speed would <br>
                 cause your subject to be blurry).</p>
          <img src="iso1.png" class="isopng">
          <h2>Low vs High ISO Noise Visibility</h2>
          <p>To give an example of two photos taken at different ISO values, take a look at the comparison below. <br> Pay attention to the level of noise (graininess and blotchy colors) in the images:</p>
          <img src="iso2.png" class="isopng2">
          <p>The difference is clear – the image at ISO 3200 has much more noise than the one at ISO 200. <br>
             This is why you should avoid high ISOs whenever possible, unless conditions require you to use them.</p>
          
          <h2>When to Use Low ISO</h2>
          <p>As discussed above, you should always try to stick to the lowest ISO (base ISO) of your camera,  <br>
             which is typically ISO 100 or 200, whenever you can. If there is plenty of light, you are free to  <br>
              use a low ISO and minimize the appearance of noise as much as possible.  <br> 
              Even in dim or dark environments, you still might be able to use a low ISO. For example, <br>
               if you have your camera mounted on a tripod or sitting completely still on a table. In that case, <br>
                you can safely use a low ISO and brighten your photo via a long shutter speed instead,  <br>
                since you won’t introduce camera shake. However, keep in mind that if your camera does use a <br>
                 long shutter speed, anything that is moving will look like a ghost:</p>
          <img src="iso3.png" class="isopng3">
          <h2>When to Use High ISO</h2>
          <p>Even though it is ideal to use low ISOs, there will be plenty of times when a high ISO is necessary <br>
             in order to take a good photo in the first place. The simple reason is that you are often fighting  <br>
             against motion blur, and you will need to pick between a sharp photo at a high ISO, or a blurry photo <br>
              at a low ISO. Take a look at the image below:</p>
          <img src="iso4.png" class="isopng4">
          <p>The photographer had successfully captured images of Black Skimmers using their camera, utilizing a shutter <br>
            speed of 1/2000th of a second and an ISO setting of 800. The fast shutter speed allowed the photographer to <br>
            freeze the motion of the birds while they were in flight. Reflecting on their photography skills, the photographer <br>
             mused on what would have happened if they had chosen to set their camera's ISO to 100 instead. In that scenario, <br>
              they would have needed to use a slower shutter speed of 1/250th of a second to achieve a properly exposed photo. <br>
               However, this slower shutter speed would have resulted in unwanted motion blur in the image, as the birds were  <br>
               moving quickly. Ultimately, the photographer concluded that choosing ISO 100 would have resulted in ruined pictures <br>
                due to the excessive motion blur.</p>
                <p>
                    In summary, increasing the ISO is a practical solution in low-light situations or when capturing fast-moving action <br>
                     to ensure sharp and well-exposed photos. Handheld indoor photos without flash often benefit from higher ISO settings <br>
                      to avoid blur. Many cameras have an Auto ISO setting allowing the photographer to set a maximum ISO limit. <br>
                       However, higher ISO settings can introduce noise in photos, so it's a trade-off between noise and motion blur <br>
                        when setting ISO and shutter speed.
