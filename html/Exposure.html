          <h2>What is Exposure in photography?</h2>
          <p>Exposure in photography can be easily explained as the amount of light collected by your camera.  <br>
            When the light passes through the camera lens to the camera sensor for a determined period of time, <br>
             the amount of light that reaches the camera will determine the final look of the image.</p>
          <img src="exposure1.png" class="exposurepng">
          <p>The main effect of photography exposure is to capture the image with a determined brightness. <br>
             When you shoot a perfectly exposed photo, you are capturing all the details in the highlights and the shadows. <br>
              The exposure effect when the camera sensor doesn’t receive enough light is called underexposure.  <br>
              We can also say that we got “crushed shadows” or we “crushed the blacks,” and the result is that we have <br>
               no information in the darkest areas of the image. In contrast, the exposure effect when the sensor captures <br>
                too much light is called overexposure. When this happens, we can also say that we have “blown out highlights” <br>
                 or “burned out highlights,” and the result is that we have no information in the brightest areas of the image.</p>

          <h2>WHAT IS EXPOSURE VALUE? THE BASIC PHOTOGRAPHY EXPOSURE SETTINGS</h2>
          <p>Exposure is not applied through a series of rules, but, rather, through three basic settings <br>
             that are the key for understanding exposure in photography and learning how to master exposure <br>
              in your images. Exposure value is the result of the interaction of the three main exposure basics: <br>
               aperture, shutter speed, and ISO. It’s measured by the light meter, as we will see later. <br>
            Now, let’s see how a basic exposure affects the exposure value.   <br></p>
            <p>EXPOSURE AND APERTURE </p>
            <p>In a few words, aperture is the opening that determines how much light passes through the camera lens to the sensor. <br>
            For this reason, exposure and aperture are completely related. If you use a wider aperture, <br>
             the camera lens will allow more light to reach the camera, and the image will be brighter (more exposed). <br>
              If, conversely, you close down your aperture and block the amount of light that passes through the lens, <br>
               the image will be darker (less exposed).</p>
