          <h2>What is Shutter Speed in photography?</h2>
          <p>Shutter speed is how long an image is exposed to light — it can be milliseconds, or even minutes. <br>
             As one of three elements that affect how light or dark an image is (called exposure), understanding <br>
              shutter speed is essential to taking full creative control of the camera. If the shutter is left <br>
               open for a long time, the lens will let in a lot of light, and unless you are shooting a very dark scene, <br>
                the image will be too bright, or overexposed. If the shutter speed is too quick, on the other hand, <br>
                 the photograph will be too dark. So what’s the right shutter speed? That depends on how much light <br>
                  is in the scene. Outdoors on a sunny day, you’ll need a quick shutter speed, like 1/500. Indoors, <br>
                   you’ll need to slow it down a bit — perhaps 1/100.</p>

          <h2>Using shutter speed for creative effects</h2>
          <img src="shutterspeed2.png" class="shutterpng2">
          <p>Shutter speed can also be used to keep the subject sharp while blurring the background. <br>
             If you follow the movement of the subject while the shutter is open, the subject will be fairly sharp <br>
              while the background will blur. Panning is a tricky technique to master and requires a bit of practice, <br>
               but it can create some neat effects. The shutter speed for the panning technique varies a bit, but it’s <br>
                often much slower, around 1/30 or 1/60. Still scenes (or those that seem still) can still use shutter speed <br>
                 for creative effects. Long exposure photography intentionally blurs some motion while keeping the rest of <br>
                  the scene still. Waterfalls with smooth white water, for example, are shot with a tripod and a long <br>
                   shutter speed. Long exposure is also a popular technique for shooting night landscapes — even if there <br>
                    is no motion (the lack of light makes it tough to achieve the right exposure without a long shutter speed). <br>
                     A tripod is required for long exposures, and if you plan on using the technique during the day, you’ll need <br>
                      a neutral density filter to prevent overexposure.</p>
          
          <h2>How do you choose a shutter speed?</h2>
          <p>Ask yourself, “What type of photo do I want to take?” Determining shutter speed is something that <br>
             requires you to consider the end goal of your photo. “If you take a waterfall picture at a regular <br>
              shutter speed, the water freezes and you get all that texture,” Carlson says. “But you’ve also seen <br>
               pictures of waterfalls where the water is smooth and silky. It’s a cool effect and it’s super easy to do. <br>
                All you do is make sure that the camera doesn’t move and you shoot with a long shutter speed. <br>
                 All those little details of the water running down will blend together and give you that look.”</p>
          <img src="shutterspeed3.png" class="shutterpng3">
          <p>Shutter speed gives the photographer the ability to use motion — or to freeze motion — to tell a tale <br>
             or capture a vibe. Whether you choose to take  that split-second snapshot with a short shutter speed or <br>
              to portray the motion of subjects in a slow shutter speed photo, you’re opening up narrative possibilities. <br>
               Is it about capturing the moment as is or trying to portray how we perceive the moment? Or even to capture <br>
                the energy of the moment instead of simply the visual details? Mastering shutter speed puts that power  <br>
                into your hands. And while technical knowledge is helpful in seeking this mastery, it’s practice that <br>
                 inevitably will build this skill for any photographer.<br>
            “You could have academic knowledge of how photography works,” Davidson relays. <br>
             “But you also need to have the practical knowledge of trying it and practicing it all the time to <br>
              put the two together.”
