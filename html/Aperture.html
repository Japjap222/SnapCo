          <h2>What is Aperture in photography?</h2>
          <p>Aperture refers to the opening of a lens's diaphragm through which light passes. <br>
               It is calibrated in f/stops and is generally written as numbers such as 1.4, 2, 2.8, 4, 5.6, 8, 11 and 16. <br>
                Lower f/stops give more exposure because they represent the larger apertures, while the higher f/stops give <br>
                 less exposure because they represent smaller apertures. This may seem a little contradictory at first but <br>
                  will become clearer as you take pictures at varying f/stops. Be sure to check your manual first to learn how <br>
                   to set Aperture Priority for your camera, then try experimenting to get comfortable with changing the aperture <br>
                    and recognizing the effects different apertures will have on the end-result image.</p>

          <h2>How Aperture Affects Depth of Field</h2>
          <p>Depth of field is the zone of acceptable sharpness in front of and behind the subject <br>
                on which the lens is focused. Simply put: how sharp or blurry is the area behind your subject. <br>
                 The lower the f/stop—the larger the opening in the lens—the less depth of field—the blurrier the background. <br>
                  The higher the f/stop—the smaller the opening in the lens—the greater the depth of field—the sharper the background.</p>
          <img src="aperture2.png" class="aperturepng2">
          <h2>How Aperture Affects Shutter Speed</h2>
          <p>Using a low f/stop means more light is entering the lens and therefore the shutter doesn't <br>
                need to stay open as long to make a correct exposure which translates into a faster shutter speed. <br>
                 Again, the reverse is true: using a high f/stop means that less light is entering the lens and therefore <br>
                  the shutter will need to stay open a little longer which translates into a slower shutter speed.</p>
