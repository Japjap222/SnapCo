                <p class="prgph1"><strong>What is the best camera for beginners? We think it's a camera that's not too expensive to buy but still <br>
                 offers great image quality and the scope to try out more advanced techniques and shooting styles as you <br>
                  learn more about photography. And for us, that means one thing: a DSLR or a mirrorless camera!</strong></p>
                <p>There's always an ongoing debate about DSLR vs mirrorless cameras and which is best, but either type is a brilliant <br>
               way to get you started in photography, and we've included both in our guide. Broadly, a DSLR will be bigger and chunkier <br>
               with better battery life. It might cost a little less to buy and you'll have a wide range of lenses to choose from. A mirrorless <br>
             camera will be smaller and lighter and will be a better choice for video and vlogging. To be honest, DSLRs are a vanishing breed <br>
              and almost all the main camera makers have swapped to developing mirrorless systems. However, if you get a Canon or a Nikon DSLR,  <br>
              there are scores of lenses to choose from and your camera is likely to be perfectly usable for years to come.</p>
                <img src="dslr.png" class="recomm1png">
                <p class="recommtitle2"><strong>When you buy, you do need to think about lenses.</strong></p>
                <p>DSLR and mirrorless cameras are typically sold both 'body only' or with a kit lens. Obviously buying body-only is cheaper, <br>
                 but it's a false economy – unless you have lenses already, it's always cheaper to get a kit rather than buy a lens separately. <br>
                  Usually, you will get a basic 3x zoom lens or similar – but that's fine to get started with. We recommend a kit lens for each <br>
                 of these cameras below and they are almost always the standard lens option for these cameras.</p>
                <h2 class="recomm1line">BEST CAMERA FOR BEGINNERS: OUR TOP PICKS</h2>
                <p>If I had to choose three tops picks for the best camera for beginners that offer the best price for performance and lens <br>
                selection then they would be the Canon EOS Rebel SL3 (aka EOS 250D / EOS 200D Mark II), Olympus OM-D E-M10 Mark IV or the <br>
                 Nikon Z50 - all of these picks offer good price to performance and also have a good lens selection to really get you started <br>
                  in your photography. If I had to pick up one it would be the Canon EOS Rebel SL3 / EOS 250D / EOS 200D Mark II due to its  <br>
                  long production run and being able to take a vast list of Canon glass that you will never get bored of shooting with.</p>

            <p>This is the best low-cost Canon DSLR and we love the flip-out screen, <br>

            <p>This isn't the cheapest DSLR you can buy by any means, but very often it's worth paying a little <br>
                extra money to get a much better range of features – and this is the perfect example. EOS Rebel SL3 <br>
                 (aka EOS 250D / EOS 200D Mark II) has Canon’s top-of-the-range APS-C sensor with 24.1MP of resolution <br>
                  and brilliant Live View shooting, thanks to a fully-articulating touchscreen display and Canon's fast <br>
                   Dual Pixel CMOS AF autofocus. </p>

                 kit lens is remarkable not just for its pancake lens dimensions but for its overall performance. Key selling <br>
                  points include 4K videos, 11fps burst shooting, and the fact that its Z mount is identical to that on the <br>
                   larger cameras, so you can use dedicated Nikkor Z DX lenses, full frame Nikkor Z lenses, and regular Nikon <br>
                    DSLR lenses via the FTZ adaptor. </p>

                  are straightforward and easy to get to grips with. Its price means it does strip back on some more advanced features. <br>
                   For example, there’s no Custom Settings menu for tailoring camera functions to your preferences, as featured on every  <br>
                   other series of Nikon DSLRs. The autofocus in Live View and movie capture modes is somewhat sluggish, though the Nikon 
                   AF-P DX 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6G VR lens speeds it up and is the best kit lens to go for. </p>
